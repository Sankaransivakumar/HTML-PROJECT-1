    <h4>The Shelby Mustang is a high-performance variant of the Ford Mustang built by Shelby American from 1965 to 1967 and by the Ford Motor Company from 1968 to 1970.
    <
        In 2005, Ford revived the Shelby nameplate for a high-performance model of the fifth-generation Ford Mustang.</h2>
    <h4>From 1965 until 2004, the Mustang shared chassis commonality with other Ford model lines, staying rear-wheel-drive throughout its production. From 1965 to 1973, the Mustang was derived from the 1960 Ford Falcon compact. From 1974 until 1978, the Mustang (denoted Mustang II) was a longer-wheelbase version of the Ford Pinto. From 1979 until 2004, the Mustang shared its Fox platform chassis with 14 other Ford vehicles (becoming the final one to use the Fox architecture). Since 2005, Ford has produced two generations of the Mustang, each using a distinct platform unique to the model line.</h4><hr>
    
    <h2>1st generation (1965–1970):</h2>

    <h4>Lee Iacocca's assistant general manager and chief engineer, Donald N. Frey was the head engineer for the T-5 project—supervising the overall development of the car in a record 18 months[19]—while Iacocca himself championed the project as Ford Division general manager.[20] The T-5 prototype was a two-seat, mid-mounted engine roadster. This vehicle employed the German Ford Taunus V4 engine.

        The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had evolved into the 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which Ford used to pretest how the public would take interest in the first production Mustang. The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the production model's front and rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 in (69 mm) lower.[21] It was originally based on the platform of the second-generation North American Ford Falcon, a compact car.[22] Gale Halderman's side view design is the basis for the first clay model</h4>
    <h2>Second generation (1974):</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Ford_Fusion_%282nd_generation%29_IMG_5310.jpg/1200px-Ford_Fusion_%282nd_generation%29_IMG_5310.jpg?20210926180750" width="500" height="300">
    <h4>The new model, called the "Mustang II", was introduced on September 21, 1973, two months before the first 1973 oil crisis, and its reduced size allowed it to compete against successful imported sports coupes such as the Japanese Datsun 240Z, Toyota Celica and the European Ford Capri[45] (then Ford-built in Germany and Britain, sold in U.S. by Mercury as a captive import car). First-year sales were 385,993 cars, compared with the original Mustang's twelve-month sales record of 418,812.[46] Ultimately, the Mustang II was an early example of downsizing that would take place among Detroit's Big Three during the "malaise era".[47]

        Iacocca wanted the new car, which returned the Mustang to its 1965 model year predecessor in size, shape, and overall styling,[48] to be finished to a high standard, saying it should be "a little jewel".[49] Not only was it smaller than the original car, but it was also heavier, owing to the addition of equipment needed to meet new U.S. emission and safety regulations. Performance was reduced, and despite the car's new handling and engineering features the galloping mustang emblem "became a less muscular steed that seemed to be cantering".</h4>
    <h2>Third generation(1979):</h2>
    <img scr
    <h4>he 1979 Mustang was based on the larger Fox platform (initially developed for the 1978 Ford Fairmont and Mercury Zephyr). The larger body with an increased wheelbase yielded more interior space for four passengers, especially in the back seat, as well as a larger capacity trunk and a bigger engine bay.[51]

        Body styles included a coupe (or notchback), hatchback, and convertible which was added for the 1983 model year. Available trim levels included an unnamed base model (1979–1981), Ghia (1979–1981), Cobra (1979–1981, 1993), L (1982–1984), GL (1982–1983), GLX (1982–1983), GT (1982–1993), Turbo GT (1983–1984), LX (1984–1993), GT-350 20th anniversary edition (1984), SVO (1984–1986) and Cobra R (1993)</h4>
    <h2>Fourth generation (SN95; 1994):</h2>
    <h4>In November 1993, the Mustang debuted its first major redesign in fifteen years. Code-named "SN95" by the automaker, it was based on an updated version of the rear-wheel drive Fox platform called "Fox-4." The new styling by Patrick Schiavone incorporated several styling cues from earlier Mustangs.[53] For the first time since its introduction 1964, a notchback coupe model was not available. The door windows on the coupe were once again frameless; however, the car had a fixed "B" pillar and rear windows.

        The base model came with a 3.8 OHV V6 3.8 L (232 cu in) engine rated at 145 bhp (108 kW) in 1994 and 1995, or 150 bhp (110 kW) (1996–1998), and was mated to a standard 5-speed manual transmission or optional 4-speed automatic.</h4>
    <h2>Fifth generation (S197; 2005):</h2>
    <h4>Ford introduced a re-designed 2005 model year Mustang at the 2004 North American International Auto Show, codenamed "S197", that was based on the new D2C platform. Developed under the direction of chief engineer Hau Thai-Tang, a veteran engineer for Ford's IndyCar program under Mario Andretti, and exterior styling designer Sid Ramnarace,[64] the fifth-generation Mustang's styling echoes the fastback Mustang models of the late-1960s. Ford's senior vice president of design, J Mays, called it "retro-futurism". The fifth-generation Mustang was manufactured at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan.

        For the 2005 to 2010 production years, the base model was powered by a 210 hp (157 kW; 213 PS) cast-iron block 4.0 L SOHC V6, while the GT used an aluminum block 4.6 L SOHC three-valve Modular V8 with variable camshaft timing (VCT) that produced 300 hp (224 kW; 304 PS). </h4>
    <h2>Sixth generation (S550; 2015):</h2>
    <h4>The sixth generation Mustang was unveiled on December 5, 2013, in Dearborn, Michigan; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; Barcelona, Spain; Shanghai, China; and Sydney, Australia.[71] The internal project code name is S550.[72]

        Changes include a body widened by 1.5 inches and lowered 1.4 inches, a trapezoidal grille, and a 2.75-inch lower decklid, as well as new colors. The passenger volume is increased to 84.5 cubic feet, the wheelbase is still 8 ft. 11.1 in. (107.1 in.),</h4>
    <h2>Seventh generation (S650; 2024):</h2>
    <h4>n November 17, 2019, Ford announced the Ford Mustang Mach-E.[88] Unrelated to any of the pony car Mustang versions, it is an electric crossover with rear-wheel or all-wheel drive, depending on trim level.[89] It has 210–375 miles (340–605 km) of range and an updated Ford Sync system with a 15.5 inch display.[90] The Mustang Mach-E comes in several different trims including First Edition, Select, Premium, California Route 1, and GT.[91] The Mach-E also offers two battery options, and Ford is expected to introduce a third option in the future.</h4>
    <h2>Awards:</h2><hr>
    <h4>The 1965 Mustang won the Tiffany Gold Medal for excellence in American design, the first automobile ever to do so.

        The Mustang was on the Car and Driver Ten Best list in 1983, 1987, 1988, 2005, 2006, 2011, and 2016. It won the Motor Trend Car of the Year award in 1974 and 1994.</h4><hr>
